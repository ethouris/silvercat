C1:DEPLIB_COMMON_LANGUAGE
The dependency trakcing for program target and dependent library target should also check the languages used in all of them, and forcifully set language on the program to the value of [GetCommonLanguage] of them all.
:TESTING

C2:REORDER_DEPENDENT_LIBRARY_TARGETS
When a target has dependencies (both manually declared and generated, such as "all"), this must build the dependency tree and reorder targets so that the dependent target are always preceded by their dependency.
:PENDING

C3:ALLOW_EXTERNAL_PROFILES
Profiles should be able to be declared externally (with their names). If a namespace-based name is used, the profile should be tried to be loaded as module, unless the namespace name is already defined. 
:PENDING

C4:SPREAD_PROFILE_DEFINED_FRAMEWORKS
Profiles should provide also frameworks that are in force for all targets. Targets that don't want particular framework should be able to remove the framework from their framework cell in their database.
:PENDING

C5:HONOR_USER_DEFINED_OBJECT_FILE
The procedure processing sources should check if the object *.o file isn't already defined as, e.g. "ag long.o -depends long.cc". If so, this object file should be used instead of an autogenerated prospective "long.ag.o" (that is, the generation of long.ag.o should be skipped and if the long.cc was used as a source file of any target, put long.o instead of long.ag.o in its ingredients for linkage).
:PENDING
