C2:REORDER_DEPENDENT_LIBRARY_TARGETS
When a target has dependencies (both manually declared and generated, such as "all"), this must build the dependency tree and reorder targets so that the dependent target are always preceded by their dependency.
>>Currently this is resolved only for automatically generated 'all' target. The dependent targets are required to be defined in the correct order. Needs further testing to determine what corner cases this case may face and what the required solution should be.
:INCOMPLETE

C3:ALLOW_EXTERNAL_PROFILES
Profiles should be able to be declared externally (with their names). If a namespace-based name is used, the profile should be tried to be loaded as module, unless the namespace name is already defined. 
:PENDING

C4:SPREAD_PROFILE_DEFINED_FRAMEWORKS
Profiles should provide also frameworks that are in force for all targets. Targets that don't want particular framework should be able to remove the framework from their framework cell in their database.
:TESTING

C5:HONOR_USER_DEFINED_OBJECT_FILE
The procedure processing sources should check if the object *.o file isn't already defined as, e.g. "ag long.o -depends long.cc". If so, this object file should be used instead of an autogenerated prospective "long.ag.o" (that is, the generation of long.ag.o should be skipped and if the long.cc was used as a source file of any target, put long.o instead of long.ag.o in its ingredients for linkage).
:PENDING

C7:ADD_FRAMEWORK_INIT_CALLBACK  :C4
Add a new callback to frameworks, which is run always only once.
:PENDING

C8:ADD_CUSTOM_CLEAN_RULE
Add a possibility to add a "custom clean" rule, for cases when the autoclean wouldn't be appropriate.
:PENDING

C10:IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC_LIBRARY_AND_RUNTIME_TARGET
Add a definition of creating a dynamic library and make it define targets that do:
 - runtime: will install only dynamic libraries
 - devel: will install dynamic libraries, static libraries and headers
A configuration item (-install? -libtype?) should define what types of resources should be installed. The possible types would be:
 - runtime: define install runtime target with dynamic library
 - static: add static library AND HEADERS to devel target
 - headers: add header files to devel target
The following install targets should be defined:
 - install-runtime: if "runtime" type was added
 - install-devel: if either of "static" or "headers" was defined. Note that "static" implies "headers"
 - install: depends on both runtime and devel, or whichever is defined
