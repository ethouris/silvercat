The tclmake tool (make.tcl)
===========================

Requires Makefile.tcl build configuration. This works merely like the
usual 'make' tool. The example simple Makefile:

///////////////////////////////
CC=gcc

hello.o: hello.c hello.h
	$(CC) -o $@ $<

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

can be written in Makefile.tcl as:

/////////////////////////////
set CC gcc

rule hello.o hello.c hello.h {
	$CC -o $@ $<
}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

It has also several more advanced facilities, and it covers practically
all important features of the 'make' tool, except default rules.


The silvercat tool (ag.tcl)
===========================

Currently supported features:

1. The only currently used configuration file name: Makefile.ag.tcl

2. The most basic target definition command: ag

3. Two subcommands are supported:

	-ag.tcl genrules - print rules to produce given target for Makefile.tcl on stdout
	-ag.tcl make - use the rules for given target to make the target directly
